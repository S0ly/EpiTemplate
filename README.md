# EpiTemplate

EpiTemplate is a modular, clean, designed to enhance your workflow at Epitech on C projects. It is part of the EpiTools suite and is specifically designed to work seamlessly with EpiTools to provide an efficient and streamlined programming environment.

## Overview

EpiTemplate is designed with modularity and cleanliness in mind. By using this template, you can set up new projects easily and efficiently, adhering to Epitech's coding standards. It is also seamlessly integrated with other tools in the EpiTools suite, such as EpiForge and EpiCheck, to further improve your productivity and code quality.

## Installation

To use EpiTemplate, you need to have Epitools installed. You can automatically install EpiTemplate using a tool in Epitools. If you prefer to install it manually, follow these steps:

1. Copy all the contents of this repository into your own project repository.

That's it! You now have EpiTemplate installed and ready to use.

## Usage

EpiTemplate is designed with modularity in mind. It is divided into multiple systems, each consisting of a header file in the `includes` folder and a folder in the `src` folder. You will put your code for each system in the corresponding `src` folder.

Here's how you can use EpiTemplate effectively:

1. Identify the system you want to work on.

2. Locate the corresponding header file in the `includes` folder.

3. Open the `src` folder of the respective system.

4. Write your code for that system in the folder within the `src` folder.

By organizing your code this way, you can easily manage different components of your project and ensure modularity.

When working with EpiTemplate, we follow the Gitmoji convention for commits. Here's an example of how to create a commit:

```plaintext
$ git commit -m ":emoji: General title" -m "Commentary if needed"
```

Make sure to use an appropriate emoji from the Gitmoji guide to describe the nature of your changes.

It's recommended to work on branches when making changes to the project. This helps isolate your work and makes it easier to manage and review changes. Once you're confident that your changes are working as expected, you can push them to your branch on GitHub using:

```plaintext
$ git push origin your-branch-name
```

Before pushing your changes, make sure they do not introduce any new bugs and that all existing functionality still works as expected.
